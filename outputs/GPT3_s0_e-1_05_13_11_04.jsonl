The group operation is defined as (a, b) * (c, d) = (ac + bd, ad + bc). On the other hand, D_4 is the dihedral group of order 8, which means that its elements are the vertices and edges of a square.

A vector function is a function that takes a real number as input and outputs a vector. We can see that r(t) takes a real number t as input and outputs a vector [8 - 4t^3, 2 + 5t^2, 9t^3]. Therefore, r(t) is a vector function.\n\nSecond, we need to check if the domain of r(t) is an interval. The domain of r(t) is all real numbers. Therefore, the domain of r(t) is an interval.\n\nThird, we need to check if r(t) is one-to-one. A function is one-to-one if every element in the range of the function corresponds to a unique element in the domain of the function. In other words, a function is one-to-one if no two elements in the range of the function have the same image in the domain of the function. We can see that r(t) is one-to-one because no two elements in the range of r(t) have the same image in the domain of r(t).\n\nFourth, we need to check if r(t) is onto. A function is onto if the range of the function is equal to the codomain of the function.

We can see that r(t) is onto because the range of r(t) is equal to the codomain of r(t).\n\nTherefore, the answer is True.", "answer_type": "bool"}

According to Wikipedia, uniform continuity is a type of continuity that requires the continuity of a function to be uniform on a given set. In other words, given any small value of \u03b5, there exists a corresponding small value of \u03b4 such that whenever the difference between the input values of a function is less than \u03b4, the difference between the output values of the function is less than \u03b5.\n\nNow that we know the definition of uniform continuity, we can go back to the question. To show that f is uniformly continuous on R, we need to show that for any small value of \u03b5, there exists a corresponding small value of \u03b4 such that whenever the difference between the input values of f is less than \u03b4, the difference between the output values of f is less than \u03b5.\n\nWe can see that the function f is continuous on R, so we just need to find a \u03b4 that works for all \u03b5.\n\nWe know that for any x in R, we have |f(x)| = |(x^3)/(1+x^2)| <= |x^3|.\n\nTherefore, for any \u03b5 > 0, we can choose \u03b4 = \u03b5/|x^3|.\n\nNow we just need to show that whenever |x - y| < \u03b4, we have |f(x) - f(y)| < \u03b5.\n\nWe have\n\n|f(x) - f(y)| = |(x^3)/(1+x^2) - (y^3)/(1+y^2)|\n= |x^3 - y^3|/|1 + x^2|/|1 + y^2|\n<= |x - y|/|1 + x^2|/|1 + y^2|\n<= |x - y|/|x^2 - 2xy + y^2|\n<= |x - y|/|x - y|^2\n= 1/|x - y|\n< \u03b5/|x^3|\n= \u03b4\n\nTherefore, f is uniformly continuous on R.", "answer_type": "bool"}

In complex analysis, two sets U and V are called conformally equivalent if there is a conformal mapping f from U to V.

We know that f is a bijective holomorphic function, so f is continuous and differentiable. f is also one-to-one since U^n and B_n are both sets in C^n.\n\nNow we need to check if f'(z) is never zero for any z in U^n. We know that f'(z) is the derivative of f with respect to z.

Each molecule of water is made up of 2 hydrogen atoms, so this means that there are approximately 4.22 x 10^24 hydrogen atoms in 350,000 liters of water.\n\nNow, we need to know how many of these hydrogen atoms are protons. The atomic number of hydrogen is 1, which means that every atom of hydrogen has 1 proton.

So the semi-annual coupon rate is 8%/2 = 4%.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the present value of the bond. The present value of the bond is the sum of the present value of all the cash flows, which include the semi-annual coupon payments and the face value of the bond.\n\nThe present value of the semi-annual coupon payments can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nPV = C \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}\n\nwhere C is the coupon payment, r is the semi-annual coupon rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nFor this bond, we have C = 4%, r = 9%, and n = 36. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPV = 4% \\frac{1 - (1 + 9%)^{-36}}{9%}\n\n= 4% \\frac{1 - (1.09)^{-36}}{0.09}\n\n= 4% \\frac{1 - 0.4035}{0.09}\n\n= 4% \\frac{0.5965}{0.09}\n\n= $26.19\n\nThe present value of the face value of the bond can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nPV = F \\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}\n\nwhere F is the face value of the bond, r is the semi-annual coupon rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nFor this bond, we have F = 100, r = 9%, and n = 36. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nPV = 100 \\frac{1 - (1 + 9%)^{-36}}{9%}\n\n= 100 \\frac{1 - (1.09)^{-36}}{0.09}\n\n= 100 \\frac{1 - 0.4035}{0.09}\n\n= 100 \\frac{0.5965}{0.09}\n\n= $596.50\n\nTherefore, the present value of the bond is the sum of the present value of the semi-annual coupon payments and the present value of the face value of the bond, which is $26.19 + $596.50 = $622.69.", "answer_type": "float"}
