# TheoremQA
The dataset and code for paper: TheoremQA: A Theorem-driven Question Answering dataset

## Introduction
We propose the first question-answering dataset driven by STEM theorems. We annotated 800 QA pairs covering 350+ theorems spanning across Math, EE&CS, Physics and Finance. The dataset is collected by human experts with very high quality. We provide the dataset as a new benchmark to test the limit of large language models to apply theorems to solve challenging university-level questions.
